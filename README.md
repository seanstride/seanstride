## About me

Since 2017 I have been a senior software developer working for bet365 developing applicationsused throughout the business. I have been with bet365 since 2011 and haved worked my way through the ranks starting as a junior developer. I enjoy blogging and there are a number of articles available via my website which is linked to below. Software development and everything related to it is not just a job for me and is more like a hobby, so I invest as much time as I can into it. I enjoy getting involved with the developemnt community and I have recently founded a new user group based in Stoke-on-Trent called dotNET Stoke. This user group will primarily focus on .NET content but this will be sprinkled with content around software development in general. I recently presented for the first time at a user group that I regularly attend and I am hoping to increase the frequency of my speaking over the coming years as it is something I really enjoy.
